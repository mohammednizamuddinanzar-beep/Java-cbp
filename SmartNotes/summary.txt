Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm based on classes and objects that promotes code reusability and modularity.

Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.

Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent different data types or methods.

Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data and methods together while restricting direct access to data.

Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.
